# Compiled ATLAS for OSX El Capitan (Macbook Pro 13 inch)

Surpisingly I didn't think that this ATLAS library will took me **8 hours** to compile, and I could not find any precompiled ATLAS in brew or something.

So this might save someone's precious time. If the specs of PC does not exactly match mine, try at your own risk.
